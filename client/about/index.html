          <h2>Welcome to Loopin!</h2>
          <p>
            Loopin was created with one mission in mind - to simplify group
            event planning. Whether you're organising a party, a weekend away,
            or a family reunion, planning events as a group should be fun, easy
            not stressful. Loopin is here to help keep everyone in the loop and
            ensure everything is handled smoothly.
          </p>

          <h3>Our Purpose</h3>
          <p>
            We know that organising an event involves a lot of moving parts, and
            when multiple people are involved, it can be challenging to keep
            everyone on the same page. Loopin was built to bridge this gap by
            offering a simple, intuitive platform for event planners and
            participants. With Loopin, members can create and assign tasks,
            track what’s done, and monitor what still needs doing in one
            convenient place.
          </p>

          <h3>Why Choose Loopin?</h3>
          <p>Our platform allows groups to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Streamline event planning through organised task lists</li>
            <li>
              Assign tasks to specific members, so nothing falls through the
              cracks
            </li>
            <li>Track event progress and see what’s completed at a glance</li>
            <li>Communicate easily with our chat page</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Loopin is designed to take the stress out of planning, so you and
            your group can focus on enjoying your time together.
          </p>
